# TV-Show-Downloader
This is a project I've been working on. It's written in python 3.6.8, it is built on top of the Flask framework.
It make a request to TheMovieDB and ask for the given show/movie, It will reply with the info, it will then find the show online.

It is designed to run on single-board computers like a Raspberry Pi, but can run on more powerful devices, there isn't much penalties increase!

It was an idea given to me, and it has been my favourite and my main project for the past few weeks.
It is desgined to stop people over paying TV companys ([Sky NZ](https://www.sky.co.nz)) by LEGALLY downloading TV shows from internation TV company.
